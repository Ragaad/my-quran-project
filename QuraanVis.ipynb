        "    *   **Topic Modeling**: Identify recurring themes and topics within Surahs or Ayahs (verses) based on `ayah_ar`, `word_ar`, `word_en` (English translation), and `word_tr` (transliteration).\n",
        "    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: While complex for religious texts, one could explore patterns of praise, warning, or guidance.\n",
        "    *   **Named Entity Recognition**: Identify names of prophets, places, or significant events mentioned in the text.\n",
        "    *   **Word Embeddings/Language Models**: Train custom Arabic word embeddings or fine-tune existing Arabic language models (e.g., BERT, AraBERT) on this dataset to understand semantic relationships within Quranic vocabulary.\n",
        "    *   **Text Classification**: Classify Ayahs or Surahs based on their content, themes, or historical context (e.g., Makki vs. Madani Surahs if such metadata is available or can be inferred).\n",

        "2.  **Multilingual Text Mining**:\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing Module:**\n",
        "    *   **Functionality:** Handles loading the Quranic dataset (`Buraaq/quran-md-words`), applying Arabic text cleaning (diacritic removal, punctuation removal, character standardization), and tokenization.\n",
        "    *   **Input:** Hugging Face dataset ID.\n",
        "    *   **Output:** Cleaned and tokenized text data (e.g., `cleaned_word_ar`, `cleaned_ayah_ar` columns).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Text Analysis Module:**\n",
        "    *   **Functionality:**\n",
        "        *   **Word Frequency Analysis:** Calculates and stores the frequency of words (e.g., top N frequent words per Surah, overall word frequencies).\n",
        "        *   **Topic Modeling:** Implements LDA or NMF to extract topics from Surah texts and assigns topic probabilities to each Surah.\n",
        "    *   **Input:** Preprocessed text data.\n",
        "    *   **Output:** Word frequency lists, topic-word distributions, Surah-topic distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Visualization Module:**\n",
        "    *   **Functionality:** Renders interactive visualizations based on the analysis results.\n",
        "    *   **Sub-components:**\n",
        "        *   **Surah Selection:** A dropdown or list to select individual Surahs.\n",
        "        *   **Frequent Words View:** Bar charts or word clouds displaying the top N most frequent words for the selected Surah.\n",
        "        *   **Topic Distribution View:** Bar charts showing the probability distribution of topics for the selected Surah.\n",
        "        *   **Topic Explorer:** A view to see the top words for each topic, possibly with a topic selection mechanism.\n",
        "        *   **Overview Dashboard:** A summary view showing high-level statistics (e.g., total word count, number of Surahs, overall dominant topics).\n",
        "    *   **Output:** Interactive charts and graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **User Interface (UI):**\n",
        "    *   **Functionality:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system, select Surahs, explore topics, and view visualizations.\n",
        "    *   **Elements:** Navigation panel, input fields for parameters (e.g., `top_n` for words, number of topics for LDA), display area for visualizations, search bar for specific words or Ayahs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Functionalities:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Dynamic Word Frequency:** Allow users to specify `N` for top words and view word frequencies for any selected Surah.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Topic Exploration:** Enable users to delve into specific topics by viewing their defining words and identifying which Surahs are strongly associated with particular topics.\n",
        "*   **Cross-Lingual Insights:** If more comprehensive translations are integrated, allow comparison of word usage patterns or thematic consistency across Arabic, English, and transliterated versions.\n",
        "*   **Search and Filter:** Implement robust search capabilities for words, Ayahs, or Surahs, potentially filtering by topic or word frequency.\n",
        "*   **Export Capabilities:** Allow users to export visualizations or raw data (e.g., top word lists, topic distributions) for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Enhancements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Audio Integration (if available):** If audio data becomes accessible, add functionalities like playing audio clips for selected words/Ayahs and visualizing audio features (e.g., spectrograms, pitch). This would enable audio-text alignment visualization and even advanced ML tasks like ASR or TTS.\n",
        "*   **Word Context:** Display example Ayahs where a frequent word appears.\n",
        "*   **Semantic Search:** Beyond keyword search, allow searching for semantically similar words or concepts.\n",
        "*   **Historical Context:** If metadata like Makki/Madani revelation periods are available, enable comparison of linguistic or thematic shifts over time."

        "### Data Preprocessing\n",
        "*   Arabic text from `word_ar` and `ayah_ar` columns was successfully preprocessed by removing diacritics, punctuation, and standardizing characters (e.g., unifying different forms of Alif). This created `cleaned_word_ar` and `cleaned_ayah_ar` token lists, which are crucial for accurate NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Word Frequency Analysis\n",
        "*   The most frequent Arabic words were successfully identified and counted for each Surah. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah, words like 'من', 'الله', 'ان', 'ما', 'ولا' were among the top occurrences.\n",
        "*   Visualization through bar charts effectively highlighted the distribution of top words within selected Surahs, providing a clear view of their prominence.\n",
        "*   Word clouds were generated for selected Surahs, offering an intuitive visual representation of the most frequent words and their relative importance, with proper Arabic rendering.\n",

        "*   **Refine Topic Modeling:** Experiment with different numbers of topics (`n_topics`) or alternative topic modeling algorithms (e.g., NMF) to potentially extract more coherent and interpretable themes.\n",
        "*   **Stopword Removal:** Implement a custom Arabic stopword list to further enhance the relevance of frequent words and topic words, as common conjunctions and prepositions currently dominate.\n",
        "*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Explore sentiment analysis on the Arabic text to understand emotional tones or categories of verses.\n",

        "*   **Arabic Text Preprocessing**: Arabic text from the `word_ar` and `ayah_ar` columns was successfully cleaned and tokenized. This involved removing diacritics, punctuation, and standardizing characters (e.g., unifying Alif forms), producing `cleaned_word_ar` and `cleaned_ayah_ar` token lists essential for downstream analysis.\n",
        "*   **Frequent Word Identification**: The top 10 most frequent words were identified for each Surah. For instance, in Surah 'البقرة', words like 'من', 'الله', 'ان', 'ما', and 'ولا' were among the top occurrences. These frequencies were effectively visualized using bar charts for specific Surahs and word clouds for a broader selection of Surahs, showcasing their prominence visually.\n",
        "*   **Topic Modeling with LDA**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the aggregated text of each Surah, successfully identifying 10 distinct topics.

        "*   **Topic Distribution Visualization**: The distribution of these 10 topics across individual Surahs was visualized. For example, a bar chart illustrated the topic probabilities for Surah 'البقرة'. Additionally, word clouds were generated for each of the 10 identified topics, providing a visual summary of the key terms associated with each theme.\n",

Implementing a custom Arabic stopword list would also enhance the relevance of frequent words and topic interpretations.\n"
