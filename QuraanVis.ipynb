        "*   **Arabic Text Preprocessing**: Arabic text from the `word_ar` and `ayah_ar` columns was successfully cleaned and tokenized. This involved removing diacritics, punctuation, and standardizing characters (e.g., unifying Alif forms), producing `cleaned_word_ar` and `cleaned_ayah_ar` token lists essential for downstream analysis.\n",
        "*   **Frequent Word Identification**: The top 10 most frequent words were identified for each Surah. For instance, in Surah 'البقرة', words like 'من', 'الله', 'ان', 'ما', and 'ولا' were among the top occurrences. These frequencies were effectively visualized using bar charts for specific Surahs and word clouds for a broader selection of Surahs, showcasing their prominence visually.\n",
        "*   **Topic Modeling with LDA**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the aggregated text of each Surah, successfully identifying 10 distinct topics. Each topic was characterized by its top 10 words (e.g., common Arabic terms like 'الله', 'من', 'ان', 'في', 'الذين'), which suggest underlying thematic structures.\n",
        "*   **Topic Distribution Visualization**: The distribution of these 10 topics across individual Surahs was visualized. For example, a bar chart illustrated the topic probabilities for Surah 'البقرة'. Additionally, word clouds were generated for each of the 10 identified topics, providing a visual summary of the key terms associated with each theme.\n",
        "*   **Conceptual Design for Visual Analytics**: A comprehensive conceptual design for a visual analytics system was outlined, integrating data ingestion, text analysis (word frequency and topic modeling), and visualization modules. This design highlighted functionalities such as dynamic word frequency display, interactive topic exploration, and potential future enhancements like audio integration and semantic search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The preprocessing of Arabic text, including diacritic removal and character standardization, is crucial for accurate NLP tasks and reveals fundamental linguistic and thematic patterns within the Quranic text.\n",
        "*   Further refinement of topic modeling by experimenting with different numbers of topics or alternative algorithms (e.g., NMF) could yield more nuanced and interpretable themes. Implementing a custom Arabic stopword list would also enhance the relevance of frequent words and topic interpretations."

        "    *   **Word Embeddings/Language Models**: Train custom Arabic word embeddings or fine-tune existing Arabic language models (e.g., BERT, AraBERT) on this dataset to understand semantic relationships within Quranic vocabulary.\n",

        "## Summary of Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Preprocessing\n",
        "*   Arabic text from `word_ar` and `ayah_ar` columns was successfully preprocessed by removing diacritics, punctuation, and standardizing characters (e.g., unifying different forms of Alif). This created `cleaned_word_ar` and `cleaned_ayah_ar` token lists, which are crucial for accurate NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Word Frequency Analysis\n",
        "*   The most frequent Arabic words were successfully identified and counted for each Surah. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah, words like 'من', 'الله', 'ان', 'ما', 'ولا' were among the top occurrences.\n",
        "*   Visualization through bar charts effectively highlighted the distribution of top words within selected Surahs, providing a clear view of their prominence.\n",
        "*   Word clouds were generated for selected Surahs, offering an intuitive visual representation of the most frequent words and their relative importance, with proper Arabic rendering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Topic Modeling\n",
        "*   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the aggregated text of each Surah, successfully identifying 10 distinct topics.\n",
        "*   Each topic was characterized by a set of top words, indicating potential themes (e.g., 'الله', 'من', 'ان', 'في', 'الذين' appearing frequently across multiple topics, suggesting fundamental Quranic concepts).\n",
        "*   The topic distribution for individual Surahs (e.g., Al-Baqarah) was visualized, showing the varying degrees to which different topics are present in each chapter.\n",
        "*   Word clouds for each identified topic provided an effective visual summary of the key terms associated with each theme.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Insights\n",
        "*   The dataset `Buraaq/quran-md-words` provides rich textual content in Arabic, English, and transliteration, enabling deep linguistic and thematic analysis.\n",
        "*   The preprocessing steps are vital for accurate analysis of Arabic text, as diacritics and character variations can significantly affect word identification.\n",
        "*   Word frequency and topic modeling reveal the linguistic patterns and thematic structures within the Quranic text, which can be invaluable for researchers, learners, and NLP applications.\n",
        "*   The visualizations generated offer clear and accessible insights into the distribution of key terms and overarching themes across the Surahs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps / Potential Future Work\n",
        "*   **Refine Topic Modeling:** Experiment with different numbers of topics (`n_topics`) or alternative topic modeling algorithms (e.g., NMF) to potentially extract more coherent and interpretable themes.\n",

        "### Data Preprocessing\n",
        "*   Arabic text from `word_ar` and `ayah_ar` columns was successfully preprocessed by removing diacritics, punctuation, and standardizing characters (e.g., unifying different forms of Alif). This created `cleaned_word_ar` and `cleaned_ayah_ar` token lists, which are crucial for accurate NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Word Frequency Analysis\n",
        "*   The most frequent Arabic words were successfully identified and counted for each Surah. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah, words like 'من', 'الله', 'ان', 'ما', 'ولا' were among the top occurrences.\n",
        "*   Visualization through bar charts effectively highlighted the distribution of top words within selected Surahs, providing a clear view of their prominence.\n",
        "*   Word clouds were generated for selected Surahs, offering an intuitive visual representation of the most frequent words and their relative importance, with proper Arabic rendering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Topic Modeling\n",
        "*   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the aggregated text of each Surah, successfully identifying 10 distinct topics.\n",
        "*   Each topic was characterized by a set of top words, indicating potential themes (e.g., 'الله', 'من', 'ان', 'في', 'الذين' appearing frequently across multiple topics, suggesting fundamental Quranic concepts).\n",
        "*   The topic distribution for individual Surahs (e.g., Al-Baqarah) was visualized, showing the varying degrees to which different topics are present in each chapter.\n",
        "*   Word clouds for each identified topic provided an effective visual summary of the key terms associated with each theme.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Insights\n",
        "*   The dataset `Buraaq/quran-md-words` provides rich textual content in Arabic, English, and transliteration, enabling deep linguistic and thematic analysis.\n",
        "*   The preprocessing steps are vital for accurate analysis of Arabic text, as diacritics and character variations can significantly affect word identification.\n",
        "*   Word frequency and topic modeling reveal the linguistic patterns and thematic structures within the Quranic text, which can be invaluable for researchers, learners, and NLP applications.\n",
        "*   The visualizations generated offer clear and accessible insights into the distribution of key terms and overarching themes across the Surahs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps / Potential Future Work\n",
        "*   **Refine Topic Modeling:** Experiment with different numbers of topics (`n_topics`) or alternative topic modeling algorithms (e.g., NMF) to potentially extract more coherent and interpretable themes.\n",
        "*   **Stopword Removal:** Implement a custom Arabic stopword list to further enhance the relevance of frequent words and topic words, as common conjunctions and prepositions currently dominate.\n",

        "*   **Other Highly Frequent Pairs**: Other notable high-frequency co-occurrences include ('السميع', 'العليم') with 175 occurrences, ('الرحيم', 'الغفور') with 134 occurrences, and ('التواب', 'الرحيم') with 112 occurrences.\n",
        "*   **Co-occurrence Matrix Creation**: A symmetric co-occurrence matrix (`co_occurrence_matrix`) was successfully generated. This matrix systematically quantifies the frequency with which every unique pair of Allah's names appears together, providing a comprehensive overview of their joint appearances.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The high co-occurrence of specific pairs, such as ('الحكيم', 'العزيز') and ('السميع', 'العليم'), suggests inherent theological or linguistic connections between these divine attributes. This could indicate that these qualities are often presented together to convey a complete divine characteristic or aspect.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could involve applying statistical measures like Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) or correlation coefficients to the co-occurrence matrix to quantify the strength of association between names, beyond mere frequency. Additionally, network analysis could be used to visualize the relationships and identify clusters of highly interconnected names.\n"

        "\n",
        "### Key Findings from the Chord Diagram:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Interconnectedness of Divine Attributes**: The Chord diagram visually confirms the strong co-occurrence patterns identified previously. The thickest arcs connecting different names of Allah highlight which divine attributes are most frequently mentioned together in the same Quranic verses.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prominent Pairs**: Consistent with the `df_co_occurrence` analysis, the diagram prominently displays strong connections for pairs like 'Al-Hakim (The Wise)' and 'Al-Aziz (The Almighty)', 'As-Sami (The All-Hearing)' and 'Al-Alim (The All-Knowing)', and 'Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful)' and 'Al-Ghafur (The All-Forgiving)'. These connections appear as significantly thicker bands, indicating a high frequency of joint appearance.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Clusters of Related Names**: The visual arrangement might also suggest clusters or groups of names that frequently appear together, forming conceptual sub-themes. For example, names related to knowledge and wisdom might form one cluster, while names related to mercy and forgiveness form another.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Asymmetry in Connections**: While the diagram displays co-occurrence, the flow of the chords can sometimes subtly hint at directional or primary-secondary relationships if one name is often mentioned immediately before or after another (though the current data aggregates counts and doesn't preserve order). However, the thickness of the bands clearly shows the strength of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Visual Clarity with English Labels**: Using English transliterated/translated names significantly improves the interpretability of the diagram for a broader audience, making it easier to identify and understand the relationships between different divine attributes without requiring Arabic proficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Chord diagram serves as an effective visual tool for understanding the thematic relationships between Allah's names in the Quran. The density and width of the chords directly correlate with the strength of co-occurrence, suggesting that these frequently paired names are often invoked together to convey a fuller, more nuanced understanding of Allah's attributes in specific contexts within the verses. For instance, the strong link between 'The Wise' and 'The Almighty' could imply that divine power is always exercised with profound wisdom."

        "*   The diagram visually confirms strong interconnectedness among divine attributes, with thicker arcs highlighting names most frequently mentioned together.\n",
        "*   Prominent co-occurrence pairs include 'Al-Hakim (The Wise)' with 'Al-Aziz (The Almighty)', 'As-Sami (The All-Hearing)' with 'Al-Alim (The All-Knowing)', and 'Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful)' with 'Al-Ghafur (The All-Forgiving)'. These pairs are represented by significantly thicker bands in the diagram.\n",
        "*   The visualization suggests potential clusters of related names, such as those pertaining to knowledge and wisdom, or mercy and forgiveness, which frequently appear together.\n",
        "*   The use of English transliterated/translated names greatly enhances the interpretability of the diagram, making it accessible to a broader audience without requiring Arabic proficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A mapping dictionary, `arabic_to_english_name_map`, was successfully created, linking each of the 99 Arabic names of Allah to its English counterpart for improved readability in visualizations.\n",
        "*   The necessary visualization libraries, `holoviews` and `bokeh`, were successfully installed after addressing initial syntax and module import errors during the setup phase.\n",
        "*   The Chord diagram was successfully generated and displayed, effectively visualizing the co-occurrence matrix of Allah's names using the prepared English labels.\n",
        "*   The Chord diagram explicitly showed strong co-occurrence patterns, particularly between divine attributes such as 'Al-Hakim (The Wise)' and 'Al-Aziz (The Almighty)', and 'Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful)' and 'Al-Ghafur (The All-Forgiving)', indicated by the thickest bands.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The strong co-occurrence of specific names (e.g., 'The Wise' and 'The Almighty') suggests that these attributes are often presented together to convey a more comprehensive understanding of Allah's characteristics, implying that divine power is often exercised with profound wisdom.\n",
        "*   To further contextualize these findings, future analysis could delve into specific Quranic verses where these highly co-occurring names appear, to uncover the precise theological or narrative reasons behind their joint mention.\n"
